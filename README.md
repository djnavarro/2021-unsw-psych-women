This repository contains the website that the UNSW School of Psychology set up for 2021 International Women's Day: http://2021.unsw-psych-women.org. It is based on the [diziet](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-diziet) theme for Hugo and generated in R using [hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown/). I would strongly advise anyone not to fork this repo: I wrote the site in a rush and have broken many, many guidelines for good practice. The technical debt on this one is quite large!
