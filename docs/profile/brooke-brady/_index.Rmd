<blockquote><p><i>"Equality in the workplace is SO IMPORTANT! I’m proud to be associated with a Faculty that has made real progress toward gender equity in the workplace. However, it’s important to acknowledge that we have a long way to go in terms of our recognition of genders that do not fit within the male-female binary. On International Women’s Day, I’ll be feeling gratitude for the great progress we have seen in women’s equality in the workplace, reflecting on the privileges I experience as a cisgender woman that are not afforded to others who have gender identities outside of the binary, and I will be hopeful for a more equitable future."</i></p></blockquote>
