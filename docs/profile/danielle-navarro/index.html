<p>Danielle Navarro is a computational cognitive scientist and Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales. Her research focuses on human concept learning and reasoning, and on statistical methods in the behavioural sciences. Other topics she has researched include data visualisation, decision making, language and cultural evolution, cognitive development, and forensic psychology. In her work as a computational cognitive scientist, she uses a mix of experimental methods and computational modelling techniques to explore how the human mind works. Danielle is a cofounder of R-Ladies Sydney, and holds editorial roles at at Science and Psychological Review. On occasions she has been known to masquerade as a statistician, data scientist, software developer and generative artist.</p>

<i>"To me, gender equality is one part of a broader liberation project. My own rights and legal protections are intimately tied to those of everyone else, and I cannot view my freedom as separate from theirs. Audre Lorde put it better than I ever could, back in 1981: 'I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own. And I am not free as long as one person of Color remains chained. Nor is any one of you.' She spoke those words 40 years ago, and they are no less true today than they were then."</i>
