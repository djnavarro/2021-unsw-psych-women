<blockquote><p><i>"To me, gender equality is one part of a broader liberation project. My own rights and legal protections are intimately tied to those of everyone else, and I cannot view my freedom as separate from theirs. Audre Lorde put it better than I ever could, back in 1981: 'I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own. And I am not free as long as one person of Color remains chained. Nor is any one of you.' She spoke those words 40 years ago, and they are no less true today than they were then."</i></p></blockquote>
