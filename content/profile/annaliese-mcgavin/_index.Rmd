> Annaliese is a PhD candidate and registered psychologist (MOrgPsych). Her research focuses on helping people tap into the potential of their mind through the mind-body connection. Particularly, she’s interested in how lifestyle factors—like diet, exercise, sleep, social connection, and stress—affect our cognitive performance, and how the gut microbiota impacts this relationship (thanks to her collaboration with the Microbiome Research Centre). Annaliese is also thrilled to be part of the UNSW Women in Maths & Science Champions Program, which promotes women in STEM and supports science communication skill development.
