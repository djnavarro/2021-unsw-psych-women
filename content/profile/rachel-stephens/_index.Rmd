> Rachel is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Sydney Thinking and Reasoning Lab at the University of New South Wales. Her research focuses on understanding the cognitive processes that underlie human reasoning and judgment. This is important given that people are increasingly asked to draw conclusions about complex issues, often based on conflicting evidence (e.g., how to make healthcare fit for the future, or how we should respond to climate change). One of her key goals is to advance the field's quantitative and methodological approaches, helping to test competing theories more rigorously. An important part of her work has involved challenging long-standing and influential dual-process theories of reasoning, which distinguish between faster, intuitive thinking and slower, deliberate thinking. This has important implications for questions such as how reasoning skills develop in children, and how we might train and encourage "better" reasoning.
