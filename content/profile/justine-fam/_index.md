> Justine is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. Her current work focuses on the neural mechanisms underpinning Pavlovian conditioning and extinction. She obtained her PhD in Psychology from UNSW, where her thesis examined the temporal dynamics and behavioural correlates of decision-making. Justine hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory by pairing neuroscience techniques with detailed analyses of behaviour.
