> Dharani is a postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. She is interested in understanding ways to augment evidence-based treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. Her current research is examining cognitive, behavioural and neurobiological predictors directing response to trauma-focused psychotherapy, with a focus to better understand mechanisms that maintain this condition.
