> For the past 21 years (14 years postdoc) Associate Professor Sylvia Gustin has been using brain imaging techniques and psychological assessment to investigate the central and psychological circuits underlying chronic pain and spinal cord injury in humans. She has experience in the use of many brain imaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography and functional, structural and biochemical magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, she has practised as a psychologist focusing on the management of chronic pain. Her aim is to increase our understanding of the development and maintenance of chronic pain and spinal cord injury, in particular psychological and central components and their association with each other. And most importantly to develop and evaluate novel interventions that can provide pain relief and touch restoration via the primary source of pain: the brain.
