> Samantha is a PhD candidate at UNSW. Her research examines the attributions people make for their eating behaviour. She is interested in the ways in which people might be motivated to deny external influences on their food intake, and the affective and behavioral consequences associated with these motivated explanations. Exploring how people conceptualise their eating behaviour can help us understand the impact of self-evaluations on health and wellbeing.
