> Saoirse is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Sydney Thinking and Reasoning (STAR) Lab. Her research focuses on the cognitive processes involved in human reasoning and judgment. People increasingly face snippets of information that they must combine to arrive at a judgment or decision (e.g. deciding whom to vote in an election, issues surrounding climate change). Are people sensitive to ways in information was initially generated? Moreover, do people take into account the reliability of the information and its source? A key goal is of Saoirseâ€™s research is to apply rigourous experimental approaches to questions concerning real-world problems. A central theme of her work has been to examine the effectiveness of corrections to misinformation and the cognitive processes involved in successful (and unsuccessful) corrections.
