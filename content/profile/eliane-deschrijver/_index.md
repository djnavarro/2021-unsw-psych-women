> Dr.Â Eliane Deschrijver (www.elianedeschrijver.com) is a postdoctoral scholar at Ghent University (Belgium) holding a fellowship of Research Foundation Flanders, who is currently based at UNSW. She is specialised in social neuroscience (EEG, fMRI, mirror neurons of actions and touch, mentalising, agency, body representation, ...) in neurotypical and clinical populations (autism, schizophrenia). She just presented to the scientific community her novel theory on human social cognition, in which she reframed the interpretation of 40 years of studies looking into false beliefs representation. She has also published on bias in student evaluation of male versus female professors. She believes that gender equity well benefit from making as much people as possible aware of these biases.
