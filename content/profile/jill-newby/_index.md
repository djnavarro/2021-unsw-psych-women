> Jill is a Senior Lecturer and NHMRC/MRFF Career Development Fellow. Her research looks at how we can use the internet, smartphones, and virtual reality in the treatment of anxiety and depression. In this research project, she is testing whether we can use a brief one-session virtual reality exposure therapy intervention to treat phobias (e.g., heights, needles & blood). She is also conducting research to explore how we can improve access to psychological treatment by using the internet and smartphones to deliver therapy. Using this approach, we can help people access affordable, high quality mental health care, regardless of where they live, or their financial circumstances.
