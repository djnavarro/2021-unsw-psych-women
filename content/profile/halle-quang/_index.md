> Halle Quang is a current PhD candidate at School of Psychology, University of New South Wales. The main focus of her research is on motivational changes and apathy in brain disorders. Her current PhD project involves applying behavioural paradigms and neuropsychological techniques to understand emotion dysregulation and its effects on the reduction of behaviour following traumatic brain injury. The study is hoped to facilitate the promotion of rehabilitation engagement and efforts in patients with traumatic brain injury. Halle has been awarded a UNSW Scientia PhD Scholarship from 2019 to 2023 for this project under the supervision of Prof Skye McDonald (UNSW), Prof Bernard Balleine (UNSW) and Dr Fiona Kumfor (University of Sydney).
